# Lane Detection Using OpenCV (Python)

This project implements a **lane detection system** using classical **computer vision techniques**.  
It processes a road video frame by frame, detects lane lines, and draws them on the output video.

The project is inspired by **autonomous driving systems**, where lane detection plays an important role in vehicle navigation.

## Features
- Detects **left and right lane lines** from road videos
- Uses **Canny Edge Detection** for edge extraction
- Applies **Region of Interest (ROI)** to focus only on the road
- Uses **Hough Line Transform** to detect straight lane lines
- Draws smooth and stable lane lines on video frames
- Supports **step-by-step visualization** for debugging

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- MoviePy  
- Google Colab

## Methodology

1. Convert each video frame to **grayscale**
2. Apply **Gaussian Blur** to reduce noise
3. Detect edges using **Canny Edge Detection**
4. Mask unnecessary regions using **Region of Interest**
5. Detect line segments using **Hough Line Transform**
6. Separate left and right lanes using slope calculation
7. Average detected lines for stability
8. Draw final lane lines on the original frame
